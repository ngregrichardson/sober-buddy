# Sober Buddy

## About

I made sober buddy in just under 5 hours to challenge myself to see how fast I could remake a friend's project.

**Your personal Alcoholics Anonymous companion**

**"The sway of alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour."**
-William James

Sober Buddy is designed to help individuals with a desire to achieve and maintain sobriety. In this process, we will learn to manage such a cruel addiction, heal wounds that were never properly tended for, and take steps in becoming better, genuine individuals.

Similar to local AA meetings near you, we will never ask you to reveal any personal information about yourself or your identity. This is always a safe space. Your privacy and recovery process deserve to be treated with such respect.

### *Who is Sober Buddy for?*
This may be a beneficial recovery resource/supplement if:
- you do not have time to regularly attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings
- you do not have access to substance abuse resources
- you want to additionally supplement your current recovery methods
- you are unsure how to start your recovery
- you need a safe space
- you or anyone you know is struggling from alcoholism/alcohol abuse
- you believe your experiences and stories may help or resonate with a recovering alcoholic.

### Background on Alcoholics Anonymous

"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a global, community-based program that was created to help those struggling with problematic drinking get sober with the support of their peers through daily meetings and discussions surrounding addiction.

- AA gives men and women a place to come together and share their experiences, recover from alcoholism and maintain sobriety.
- Its concept revolves around that premise that **alcoholism is an illness that can be managed, but not controlled.**

Some people are put off by the idea of a higher power. But AA isn’t a religious organization. The higher power doesn’t have to be God, or any specific interpretation of God.
